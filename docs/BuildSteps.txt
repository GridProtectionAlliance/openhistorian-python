Note: run these steps from root source directory (where setup.cfg is located).

Make sure root-level README.md exists, if not:
    Run CreateReadMeSymLink.cmd to create symbolic link to docs/README.md markdown.
    The .gitignore file ensures that this file will not be checked in since the one
    in the "docs" folder is considered the primary source. Note that if the root
    folder README.md is manually updated, its link relationship will be broken, in
    this case delete README.md in the root and run CreateReadMeSymLink.cmd again.

For updates, always increment version number in:
    setup.cfg

It is always best to delete the following folders before a new build:
    build/
    dist/

Build Distribution: 
    python -m build

Validate Distribution:
    twine check dist/*

Upload to PiPy:
    twine upload dist/*
