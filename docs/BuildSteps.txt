Note: run these steps from root source directory (where setup.cfg is located).

Make sure root-level README.md exists, if not:
    Run CreateReadMeSymLink.cmd to create symbolic link to docs/README.md markdown.
    The .gitignore file ensures that this file will not be checked in since the one in
    the "docs" folder is considered the primary source. Note that it is easy for the
    root README.md link relationship to its parent in the docs folder to be broken,
    always delete README.md in the root and run CreateReadMeSymLink.cmd again before
    a new build to ensure the README.md will contain the latest updates.

For updates, always increment version number in:
    setup.cfg

If docs/README.md is updated:
    delete README.md in the root and re-run CreateReadMeSymLink.cmd

It is always best to delete the following folders before a new build:
    build/
    dist/

Build Distribution: 
    python -m build

Validate Distribution:
    twine check dist/*

Upload to PiPy:
    twine upload dist/*
